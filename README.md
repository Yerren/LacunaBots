# What is Lacuna?
"[Lacuna](https://www.cmyk.games/products/lacuna) is a game for 2 players about collecting flowers on a pond at night. Draw an imaginary line between two flowers, place your pawn, and collect both flowers. Win by collecting the most flowers in the most colors!"

Lacuna is a wonderfully tactile game, and it greatly benefits from the feel of its weighty player tokens, stunning game mat, and beautiful pieces. The game shines in its ability to shift from casual to tense. From heated debates over whether there's an unobstructed line between pieces, to the players trying to keep their hands steady as they measure which token is fractionally closer to that one critical piece upon which whole game will be decided.

This implementation of Lacuna spits in the face of all of the above. So, if you have the chance to play the real board game yourself, it cannot be recommended enough.
